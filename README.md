# hello-world
HI just Starting out. i am retired and i'm trying to learn html, css, python and java script. Wow there is so much to learn. I hope i have enough life left lol. But i am going too give it a try. What i would like to create something useful for Amateur Radio use. I have these 2 routers that i have converted to work on the 2.4 GHz ham band. i would like to create a video chat communicator that will run on 2 Raspberry pi2 boards and the 2 routers will be working peer to peer with each other.
Each Router and a 2 watt linear rf amplifire will be mounted to a microwave dish up on a tower and looking line of sight at each other about 15 miles apart. They will be run on solar power/battery system. The Raspberry pi boards will be mounted to there moniters and use remote key board and mouse. Also the HD camera and mike will be mounted to the monitors and wired to the Raspberry pi boards.
